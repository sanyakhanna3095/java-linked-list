# Linked List

## Data Structure
a way of organizing and storing data; essential for optimizing algorithms and managing data effectively in applications.
Linked Lists are particularly important for dynamic memory usage.

#### Key Features of Data Structures in Java
1. Predefined and Custom Implementations:
Java provides built-in data structures (e.g., Arrays, Lists, Maps) in the Java Collections Framework.
Custom data structures can be implemented using classes and objects.


2. Dynamic Memory Allocation:
Some structures like Lists and Maps can grow or shrink dynamically, making them more flexible than fixed-size arrays.


3. Generics Support:
Data structures in Java are type-safe, allowing developers to specify the type of elements stored, reducing runtime errors.


4. Thread-Safe Options:
Java provides concurrent data structures (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList) for multi-threaded environments.

   ###
Generics in Java allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on different data types while ensuring type safety. They help in code reusability and compile-time type checking.

#### Types of Data Structures in Java
1. Linear Data Structures:
    1. Array: A fixed-size collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
    2. Linked List: A sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. 
    3. Stack: A LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure for managing elements. 
   4. Queue: A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure, often used in scheduling tasks.


2. Hierarchical Data Structures:
    1. Tree: A collection of nodes organized in a hierarchy, starting from a root node.
    2. Binary Tree: A tree where each node has at most two children.
    3. Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree with nodes organized for quick searches.
    4. Heap: A special tree-based structure for priority-based tasks.


3. Graph:
A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges where relationships are represented.
Can be directed or undirected.


4. Hash-Based Data Structures:
HashMap: Stores key-value pairs for efficient retrieval.
HashSet: Stores unique elements for quick membership checks.


5. Advanced Data Structures:
Trie: Used for prefix-based searching.
Segment Tree: Used for range queries.
Red-Black Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree.

# Linked List
linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are linked using pointers.  
Each node consists of two parts:  
    1. Data: Holds the value of the node.  
    2. Pointer: Points to the next node (or previous node, in the case of doubly linked lists).
